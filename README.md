## Introduction + What is Pomocord? 
Pomocord is an all-in-one study tool to help you stay on track when you're cramming for an exam, working on an assignment, or even reading a textbook!

Pomocord uses the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirilo back in the 1980s! This method allows you to divide your work into intervals, each being 25 minutes in length, and a 5 minute break in between. Every interval, you are to focus on doing your work, no procrastinating! But don't worry, every 4 intervals, you are awarded with a 30 minute break! Oh also, no sneaky working while you're on the break!

The Pomocord extension allows for an array of features, a key one being blocked access to sites while you're working. Popular websites like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), and [more](https://pomocord.netlify.app/blockedsites), are all not accessible when studying. This allows for minimal procrastination. Soon, you'll even be able to add your own websites that you'd like to block yourself from!

Oh, and another thing, Pomocord also cares for your health. Every so often, Pomocord sends you a notification telling you to get up and grab a drink of water. We know that when you're studying, it can be easy to disregard your health, but Pomocord will keep you right on top of it so you can be the best version of you as you prepare for that test!
